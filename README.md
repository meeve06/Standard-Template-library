WHAT IS A VECTOR IN C++?

It is a template clas in STL. It is a sequence container that can be used to store elements.I understand vectors as a combination of the features of list and array.
It is dynamic in nature like list and supports indexing like arrays. So i call it a dynamic array at times.

WHY USE A VECTOR?

Simply because it makes things easier. Just a few funtions and you will becoming a coding magician. In cases where one has to delete and add elements frequently,resize your array , handle big data within a time constraint, don't hesitate to use vectors.

VECTOR OPERATIONS THAT I'LL BE DEALING WITH ?

	1) HOW TO CREATE A VECTOR?
	2) ITERATORS
	3) MODIFIERS
	
REMEMBER----" THEORY IS GREAT BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKES PROGRAMMERS, SO DIGIN"
